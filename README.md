Platform for Planners and Architects - Electronic Plan Review

Palladio.io -
In July 2018, The Ontario Association of Architects released a report outlining the costs associated with 
Site Plan Delays: A one month delay, for a one-hundred 
unit condo building, results in over half a million dollars lost for the applicants, city, and end-users. 

Palladio is a web-based Electronic Plan Review (EPR) software for City Planners and Architects 
to discuss applications in an online pre-consultation. A chat in a professional and simple platform, saves
time and money on travel, coordination, and administration. 

Palladio is decentralized software currently running on the EVM, but subject to be developed in EOS, or other
platforms, depending on SaaS-optimization and security.   
It is free for City Planners to use, there are no commitments or subscriptions, no software to download, 
easy to use calendar for scheduling consultations, automatic notifications, and most importantly, 
the dialogues and files are all recorded on the blockchain, and eventually on IPFS.

By storing ALL relevant information on a digital ledger, countless time and human resources will be saved, 
and made open to all citizens. Pre-consultations meetings on Palladio will also serve the broader purpose 
of framing an open dialogue for public meetings. Any person or organization can tune into the pre-consultation 
meetings and observe the exchanges between City Planners and Architects.
